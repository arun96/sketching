# Sketching
Code used to run the read classification experiments.

This is very much unfinished/unpolished, and I will continue to add to it and update the README to reflect the changes.

# Generating Reads
The read simulator is a modified version of Melanie Kirsche's read simulator (https://github.com/schatzlab/centroTools/tree/master/java). To run the read simulator, TODO.

# JAVA
There are three distinct approaches used to generate the screen - a MinHash-based approach, a Minimizer-based approach, and a Uniform sampling approach. For the first two, we have the option of calculating the sketch/window size, but also the option to specify the sketch/window size that will be used.

### MinHash with calculated sketch size

### MinHash with specified sketch size

### Minimizer with calculated window size

# PYTHON
The Python implementation is not up to date.
